The `keenbytes/broccli/v3` package simplifies command line interface management. It allows you to define commands complete with arguments and flags, and attach handlers to them. The package handles all the parsing automatically.

:warning: `v3` is not compatible with `v2`. The latest version requires a context in handlers and when calling `Run` method. Also
methods for adding commands, args etc. have been shortened to `Command`, `Arg`, `Flag` and `Env`.

## Sample code
Example dummy application can be found in `cmd/example1` directory.

However, the following code snippet from another tiny project shows how the module can be used.

Import the code with the following URL:
```go
import "github.com/keenbytes/broccli/v3"
```

```go
// create new CLI object
cli := broccli.NewBroccli("snakey-letters", "Classic snake but with letters and words!", "")

// add a command and attach a function to it
cmd := cli.Command("start", "Starts the game", startHandler)
// add a flag to the command
cmd.Flag("words", "f", "", 
    "Text file with wordlist", 
    // should be a path to a file
    broccli.TypePathFile,
    // flag is required (cannot be empty) and path must exist
    broccli.IsExistent|broccli.IsRequired,
)

// add another command to print version number
_ = cli.Command("version", "Shows version", versionHandler)

// run cli
os.Exit(cli.Run(context.Background()))

// handlers for each command
func startHandler(ctx context.Context, c *broccli.CLI) int {
	fmt.Fprint(os.Stdout, "Starting with file %s...", c.Flag("words"))
	return 0
}

func versionHandler(ctx context.Context, c *broccli.CLI) int {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, VERSION+"\n")
    return 0
}
```

## Structs explained
### Broccli
The main `Broccli` object has three arguments such as name, usage and author. These guys are displayed when syntax is printed out.

### Commands
Method `AddCmd` creates a new command which has the following properties.

* a `name`, used to call it
* short `usage` - few words to display what the command does on the syntax screen
* `handler` function that is executed when the command is called and all its flags and argument are valid

#### Command Options
Optionally, after command flags and arguments are successfully validated, and just before the execution of `handler`, additional code (func) can be executed. This can be passed as a last argument.

```go
cmd := cli.Command("start", "Starts the game", startHandler, 
    broccli.OnPostValidation(func(c *broccli.Cmd) {
        // do something, even with the command
    }),
)
```

See `cmd_options.go` for all available options.

### Flags and Arguments
Each command can have arguments and flags, as shown below.

```txt
program some-command -f flag1 -g flag2 ARGUMENT1 ARGUMENT2
```

To setup a flag in a command, method `AddFlag` is used. It takes the following arguments:

* `name` and `alias` that are used to call the flag (eg. `--help` and `-h`, without the hyphens in the func args)
* `valuePlaceholder`, a placeholder that is printed out on the syntax screen, eg. in `-f PATH_TO_FILE` it is the `PATH_TO_FILE`
* `usage` - few words telling what the command does (syntax screen again)
* `types`, an int64 value that defines the value type, currently one of `TypeString`, `TypeBool`, `TypeInt`, `TypeFloat`, `TypeAlphanumeric` or `TypePathFile` (see `flags.go` for more information)
* `flags`, an int64 value containing validation requirement, eg. `IsRequired|IsExistent|IsDirectory` could be used with `TypePathFile` to require the flag to be a non-empty path to an existing directory (again, navigate to `flags.go` for more detailed information)

Optionally, a function can be attached to a boolean flag that is triggered when a flag is true. The motivation behind that was a use case when setting a certain flag to true would make another string flag required. However, it's not recommended to be used.

To add an argument for a command, method `Arg` shall be used. It has almost the same arguments, apart from the fact that `alias` is not there.

### Environment variables to check
Command may require environment variables. `Env` can be called to setup environment variables that should be verified before running the command. For example, a variable might need to contain a path to an existing regular file.

### Accessing flag and arg values
See sample code that does that below.

```go
func startHandler(ctx context.Context, c *broccli.CLI) int {
	fmt.Fprint(os.Stdout, "Starting with level %s...", c.Arg("level"))
    fmt.Fprint(os.Stdout, "Writing moves to file %s...", c.Flag("somefile"))
	return 0
}
```

`level` and `somefile` are `name`s of the argument (sometimes they are uppercase) and flag.

## Features
- [X] Flags and arguments support
- [X] Validation for basic value types such as integer, float, string, bool
- [X] Additional value types of alpha-numeric and file path
- [X] Validation for multiple values, separated with colon or semicolon, eg. `-t val1,val2,val3`
- [X] Check for file existence and its type (can be directory, regular file or other)
- [X] Post validation hook
- [X] Boolean flag on-true hook before validation
- [X] Handlers require context
